name: Order viewing and printing scope
description: User-approved print presentation and the boundary between printing and public sharing.

Order viewing is a read-only modal inside Orders. The user chose «في تبويب مستقل» for the immediate print preview, with A4 landscape based on the supplied bilingual factory template.

**Why:** The user explicitly selected a separate preview tab rather than an automatic browser print dialog.

**How to apply:** Preserve the read-only view and standalone preview when extending these actions.

Treat the supplied reference as a visual layout, not permission to expose orders publicly or reuse its sample customer/employee information and links.

**Why:** The requested work was authenticated order viewing and printing, not a public-sharing feature.

**How to apply:** Keep QR access subject to normal order-read permissions unless the user explicitly requests a separate public-sharing feature.

For order printing, show one total of all linked production orders' planned quantities, planned quantity only in each quantity cell, and Arabic plus English item names only in the item cell.

**Why:** The user requested these three display restrictions and explicitly chose the sum of planned quantities rather than requested quantities.

**How to apply:** Keep this scoped to the order print sheet; it does not authorize changes to saved quantities or the order-details screen. The approved scope preserves the separate notes column and other print content.

The user confirmed integer rounding for all quantitative print fields,
including dimensions, thickness and cylinder, not only quantities.

**Why:** when asked explicitly whether measurements should be rounded, the user
answered «نعم، جميع القيم الرقمية بما فيها المقاسات والسلندر».

**How to apply:** preserve precise saved values and calculations; apply rounding
only to print display, never to identifiers, dates or free-text notes.

The print header keeps the Arabic factory name above the English name, both
centered beside the logo, even when the application is in English.

**Why:** the user explicitly requested and approved this bilingual factory
identity layout; it is an intentional exception to English-only UI fallbacks.

**How to apply:** preserve both factory names in header refinements rather
than switching the brand identity to only the current UI language.
