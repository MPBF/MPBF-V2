# Number display formatting

Displayed numbers across the app must use Latin/English digits and thousands separators (e.g. `1,000`).

Decimal values show 0–2 fractional digits: omit the decimal point for whole numbers, strip trailing zeros, and retain up to two meaningful decimal places.

Use the current central display helper when available; do not assume the
historical camel-case helper filenames still exist. Display formatting must
group thousands, keep Latin digits, and handle DB decimal strings without
changing the raw numeric value. Use a deliberate fixed-precision formatter
only for values whose display explicitly requires that precision.

**Why:** the user explicitly confirmed app-wide English numerals and a maximum of two decimals, shown only when the value has a fractional part. Central helpers prevent inconsistent screens.

**How to apply / do NOT group these `toFixed` sites** (leave as-is):
- CSS/style values (width/height/left/top/transform/progress-bar widths).
- GPS coordinates (lat/lng/latitude/longitude) — commas corrupt them.
- Values not rendered as visible text: object-literal values, API request bodies, setState payloads, anything assigned to a key/variable.
- Percentages, hours, per-unit/gram weights, thickness (micron), dimensions (cm), small ratios — grouping is invisible/meaningless.
- Three.js / 3D scene positions.

**Gotcha:** never re-parse a formatter's output with `parseFloat`/`Number` — grouped output contains commas, so `parseFloat("1,234.5")` returns `1`. `formatNumberWithCommas` used to do this and was fixed to parse the raw value.
