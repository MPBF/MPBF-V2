name: Factory production scope
description: Approved business boundaries for per-roll execution, partial receipts, and future extensions.

Deleting a customer order from the Orders page is an explicitly approved
permanent cascade through its production orders, rolls, receipts and associated
inventory. Shared receipts retain other orders' items. This does not authorize
removing protections on standalone production-order edits or deletion.

**Why:** the user specifically requested complete removal of production data
when deleting the parent order.

**How to apply:** keep existing deletion permissions, warn before deletion,
perform cleanup atomically, and preserve unrelated orders and receipt items.

Manufacturing completion and warehouse receipt are separate business events.
Receiving all currently ready output must not close film or finish manufacturing.
Film can close below the planned target; it must close explicitly, with real
rolls, before the finished manufacturing order can be considered complete.

**Why:** the user approved per-roll progression and partial receiving during
ongoing film production, not a sequential whole-order pipeline.

**How to apply:** preserve these distinctions when adding labels, reports,
scheduling, or warehouse extensions.

The approved warehouse scope is finished goods received from production with
storage locations, not purchasing, transfers, raw materials, or customer
delivery. Industrial hardware integration, automatic scheduling and public
roll sharing need separate approval.

**Why:** these extensions were explicitly outside the user's approved scope.

**How to apply:** do not infer permission to add them from the presence of
production inventory or QR traceability.

Order release is a focused transition to ready for production, not a general
status editor or automatic manufacturing start.

**Why:** the user selected «زر تحويل للإنتاج في القائمة والتفاصيل» rather than
adding a status selector to the order-edit form, after approving a readiness-only
transition.

**How to apply:** keep both entry points and preserve explicit production start;
do not broaden the action into arbitrary historical-order reopening.

Released, untouched production plans appear as ready in film operation, but
the worker starts execution explicitly.

**Why:** the user selected «يظهر جاهزاً في الفيلم، والعامل يبدأه».

**How to apply:** do not hide eligible pending work just because execution
has not started; do not auto-start on release or create rolls or receipts
when starting. Historical, stopped and cancelled work is not new ready work.

Automatic film duration is one aggregate per production order and machine:
the time between its first and last recorded rolls, not a duration per roll.

**Why:** the user explicitly corrected «لا اريد حساب مدة كل رول اريد حساب
المدة فقط من اول رول الى اخر رول فقط» and selected «لكل أمر إنتاج على كل
ماكينة».

**How to apply:** do not substitute adjacent-roll durations, sum manual minutes,
or combine different orders/machines. Remove manual duration entry without
rewriting historical records.

لا تحذف تاريخاً أو تغير قاعدة الإنتاج المنشورة دون موافقة مستقلة.

**Why:** the user explicitly required this boundary when approving archive
performance work; optimization is not permission to discard factory history
or migrate the published database.

**How to apply:** use disposable local databases for volume benchmarks.
Any published-database change needs separate approval.

Each roll must record who created it, printed it and cut it. Per-roll receiver
tracking is explicitly out of scope.

**Why:** the user requested the production actors, then corrected the receipt
scope: «عفوا لا اريد تحديد من استلم الرول».

**How to apply:** preserve the three actual production actors. Do not add
receiver selection, per-roll receipt allocation or warehouse workflow changes
under this request.

The film-board final-roll checkbox label must be only «آخر رول», without adding
an adjacent closure explanation.

**Why:** the user explicitly requested «خيار اخر رول قم بتعديل النص بجانبه
ليكون فقط اخر رول».

**How to apply:** keep this short label while preserving the existing final-roll
closure behavior; do not restore longer explanatory checkbox text unasked.

The film operator must not have the duplicate “Close film with existing rolls”
button.

**Why:** the user requested «الغاء زر اغلاق الفيلم باستخدام الرولات المسجلة
لانه مكرر».

**How to apply:** remove that operator-board button without inferring permission
to remove the final-roll closure workflow or unrelated backend capabilities.

Do not show the film-duration summary on the film operator board; retain its
data and its display in records.

**Why:** the user said «لا اريد ظهور مدة الانتاج ... في لوحة تشغيل الفيلم
اريد فقط حفظها بالسجلات».

**How to apply:** hide the entire duration block there, including machine,
recorded-roll count and first/last timestamps; do not remove recording,
calculation or historical review.

Film operators always use phones, and must handle many customer orders with
multiple production orders.

**Why:** the user said «التعامل مع الصفحة من قبل العمال سيكون باستخدام
الهاتف دائما» and «وجود طلبات كثيرة واوامر انتاج عديدة».

**How to apply:** prioritize phone readability, short operational labels and
touch-friendly controls; group production orders by their customer order.
The film-board focus is size, raw material, film color and thickness, not
customer/production status or stage badges.

Only one customer-order group should be open at a time on the film board.

**Why:** the user selected «طلب واحد مفتوح (موصى به)» instead of showing
all customer-order groups expanded.

**How to apply:** preserve this phone-oriented disclosure preference when
changing the film board; do not expand all requests by default.
